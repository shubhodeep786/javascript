//Variable in JavaScript
//Variables in JavaScript are used to store data values. A variable is a named storage location that can hold a value, which can be changed or accessed later in the program. Variables in JavaScript are declared using the var, let, or const keywords.
//let remember = "Remember";

//let myDog = "Rex";
//let myDoga = "Fluffy";

//myDog

//const in javascript
//The const keyword is used to declare a constant variable in JavaScript, which cannot be reassigned or redeclared. The value of a const variable is fixed and cannot be changed once it has been assigned.
//const pi = 3.14159;
const pi = "Never gonna give up on u";

//Using a varaible in Javascript
