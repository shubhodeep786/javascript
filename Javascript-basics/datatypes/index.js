//values in js
//chunks of information we want to work with that information can be different types of data types in js

//Text Data
//Text data is represented by the string data type in JavaScript. Strings are sequences of characters, where each character is a Unicode code point. In JavaScript, strings are enclosed in single or double quotes. For example, 'hello' and "hello" are both strings that represent the text hello.
//"hello" is a string in JavaScript
//'hello' is a string in JavaScript
//`hello` is a string in JavaScript
//'1234567890' is a string in JavaScript
//`1234567890` is a string in JavaScript

//Numbers in JavaScript
//Numbers are represented by the number data type in JavaScript. Numbers can be integers or floating-point numbers. For example, 42 and 3.14 are both numbers in JavaScript.
//42 is a number in JavaScript
//3.14 is a number in JavaScript
//0 is a number in JavaScript
//1 is a number in JavaScript

//typeof() will return in ?
//The typeof operator returns a string indicating the type of the unevaluated operand.



//Primitive Data Types in JavaScript
//Primitive data types are the most basic data types in JavaScript. They are immutable, meaning they cannot be changed. There are six primitive data types in JavaScript: string, number, bigint, boolean, undefined, and symbol. The typeof operator can be used to determine the type of a value.
//String: Represents text data enclosed in single or double quotes.
//Number: Represents numeric data, including integers and floating-point numbers.4
//BigInt: Represents large integers that cannot be represented by the number type.
//Boolean: Represents a logical value, either true or false.
//Undefined: Represents an undefined value.
//null: Represents an empty value or no value.
//Symbol: Represents a unique value that is used as an identifier for object properties.
